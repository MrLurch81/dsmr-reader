Admin: Email
============

The application may need to send emails for certain features.

Nowadays sending email is a bit harder than it used to be, luckily due to spam prevention.
If you have experience configuring your own email server, you can do this in the Backend Email settings.

Alternatively you can use GMail, but then both the sender and receiver will be the same GMail address.

To do so, use host ``aspmx.l.google.com``, port ``25``, ``Use TLS`` and leave the username and password **blank**.
