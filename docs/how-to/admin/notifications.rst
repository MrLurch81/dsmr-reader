Copy the API key from the notification service and paste in into the the textbox for the API key. 
When you save these settings, your first notification should be sent after midnight. 
Don't worry about nightly alerts, the notifications will be sent with low priority and should not wake you up.

Telegram: How do I obtain my API key?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please note that you can only use these notifications if you have your own (chat) bot with Telegram.

More information about bots `can be found here <https://core.telegram.org/bots>`_. You will need the API key provided to you by the ``BotFather`` bot.

Telegram: How do I obtain the Chat ID?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You will also need the Chat ID to have the bot send messages to the right chat.
**By default bots are not allowed to contact anyone by themselves or see messages in a group.**

So first make sure to send a message directly to the bot as human.
Or, if you added the bot in a group, make sure it has permissions to read messages in the group and then send a message in the group accordingly.

Any message the bot receives (or is allowed to see) is sent as update to the bot.
You can use the Telegram API in your browser to see the updates for your bot.
It will contain the Chat ID you're looking for.

Construct the following URL::

    https://api.telegram.org/bot<APIkey>/getUpdates?offset=-1

For example when using the fake API key ``1268827887:ABCDEFGqdtsgtts-JDASIJDqewqkqewaq``::

    https://api.telegram.org/bot1268827887:ABCDEFGqdtsgtts-JDASIJDqewqkqewaq/getUpdates?offset=-1

You should see something similar to:

.. image:: ../../_static/faq/notifications-telegram-chat-id.png
    :target: ../../_static/faq/notifications-telegram-chat-id.png
    :alt: Telegram Chat ID

Extract the Chat ID from the response. In the example above it's ``123456789``.
You can use that ID in the Telegram notifications config of DSMR-reader.

To test notifications, you can execute the following command::

    sudo su - dsmr
    ./manage.py dsmr_notification_test

Please note that DSMR-reader will reset and wipe notification settings on any error. This can be experienced as a bit annoying.
