Admin: MQTT
===========

The application has native support for MQTT.
In the screen below you can enter all information about the broker you're using.

There are options for using different ports, SSL, authentication and even the Quality of Service (QoS) used.
More information about MQTT QoS `can be found here <https://www.hivemq.com/blog/mqtt-essentials-part-6-mqtt-quality-of-service-levels>`_.

There are multiple configurations available for sending MQTT messages to your broker.
You can enable them seperately, depending on your needs.
Many of these also allow you to define which fields are sent and how they should be identified in messages sent to the broker.

Day totals
----------

This allows you to receive the day totals in JSON format:
